title: About
---
I am a back-end engineer at Sopra Banking Software. In July 2016, I received my master's degree in Computer Science from Pau University.

Involved in the [open source community](https://github.com/cfollet), I attend to meetups and conferences like [EclipseCon France](https://www.eclipsecon.org/france2016/) in June 2016.

In my spare time, I care about typography, design and photography. I love swimming and doing Freeletics workout.
